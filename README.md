# myFitnessApp

> This is one of my final projects in school for an intro Java class. I created a fitness app that could calculate your BMI, serialize and deserialize your personal information into JSON formatting, and also calculate your one rep max for various lifts. You navigate to the different portions using the menu in the app.
